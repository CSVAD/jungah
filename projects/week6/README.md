## README for ColorPalette  

From the previous drawing tool assignment, I found it easy to control drawing parameters using strokes. Here, I also tried to control the gradient of colors using storke speed. First, you can select the initial color of the stroke by clicking the left button of mouse on top of the small palette shown in the upper left corner. You can give variations of colors by varing the speed of the stroke. Then, you can choose the colors that you would like to add to palette by clicking the right button of mouse at the position where the color is drawn. I have intended to create this for an artist or a designer who find it easy to control strokes rather than picking colors in a discrete manner. I find it quite easy to use once you hear the instruction on how to use it. Next time I hope to try different kinds of original palette such as a color wheel to show different combinations of colors when the stroke is drawn.
