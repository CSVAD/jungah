## Description about wallpaper 

My inspiration for creating the wallpaper was Bauhaus Weathered Wood Peel and Stick Wallpaper by NuWallpaper, which has a 3D effect.

I wanted to create similar effects with more colors. 
Sub-images contain gradations of color since I changed colors gradually according to the size of each face.
