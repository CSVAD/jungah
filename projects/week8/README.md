## Reflection on the Plotter Drawing assignment 

- New challenges or constraints: 
As the Axidraw plotter was plotting, I found out that some pens were bending due to the pen pressure, which was not controllable. Also, the position of pen moved upward when it cannot be tightend well to the machine. So I had to stop the machine in the middle and resume it after repositioning the pen. The algorithm had to be modified in order to make the physical movement more efficient rather than to make the software itself to be optimized.   

- New expressive opportunities: 
Plotting dots with equal size and placing them at equal distances are very difficult with human effort. I found it very easy to use the Axidraw to create repeated patterns and shapes defined by mathematical equations. In addition, plotting the drawing with the machine generated more lively outputs and some unexpected effects due to physical interactions between the pen and the paper.
