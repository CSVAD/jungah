## Description about the Parametric 3D Form. 

I first began by modifying paraForm1.pde code to draw a torus.
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus) 
Since torus does not have many parameters to change, I switched some variables like theta and phi with each other. 
The range of phi was constrained from 0 to 2pi while the range of theta was controlled by thetaconst from 1 to 8.
I have added several variables such as a and b which are coefficients for cosine and sine waves. In addition, Rand rr variables are added to regulate the size of the shape.
