## Reflection (Week 6: Interface)   

Alan Kay mentions the difference between the main jobs of the visual system and the symbolic system: The visual system's main job is to be interested in everything in a scene, to dart over it as one does with a bulletin board, to change context. On the other hand, the symbolic systems's main job is to stay with a context and to make indirect connections.    

The reason these sentences stand out to me is that I myself is a figurative person and get distracted for many visual pop ups. As he continued, I realized that it is important to consider the suitable combination of both visual and symbolic parts of the system to force synergy between them in the user interface design. 

Schachman added that many of our most profound ideas we think of visually or kinesthetically, which was one of the reasons that he suggested alternative physical interface possibilities for programming such visual and touch screen interfaces.   

In addition, I am very fascinated by how pioneers of user interface design have reconsidered the question, who are the programmers? In order for these concepts to be profoundly incorporated in the user interface design, it might take another five years and experiments with thousands of users. However, it seems very promising to see this progress and I look forward to see a paradigm shift from alternative programmers.
