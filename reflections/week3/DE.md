This paper introduced the Juxtapose code editor and runtime environment for designing multiple alternatives of both application logic and interface parameters. I think this kind of interaction design tool is very helpful since I struggle many times trying to recover application parameters that I have used. Especially automatically generated contorl widgets seem very useful since they allow designers to tune application parameters easily. For developers like myself, Juxtapose could be more satisfactory since it gives more control to users rather than the algorithm generates parameter values as in the case of Design Galleries.
