I agree that children of this age are much more familiar with computers and machines since they grew up with them. It is not a question of whether the computer will replace man anymore. It is a question of how it will replace man and how we should react to the change. As mentioned in the reading, the processes involved in making computer art best suited to those who follow an analytical approach in their work, who are concerned with permutational procedures, serial techniques or the transformations of images from one finite state to another. For the same reason, many educational systems have been emphasizing computational thinkings. However, I do believe that cyberethics and other humanity areas will be as important as development of technology. It is only these area that can regulate and prevent what could go wrong with the rapid advancement of technology.
