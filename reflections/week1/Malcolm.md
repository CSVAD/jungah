I agree with the author's point that painting is different with music in a way that its authorship and execution are united. However, as mentioned in ref.[2], I do not think that painting defies notation. Even thought every painting has different style, we can communicate through painting if we share common cultural backgrounds. I think it is a matter of defining which level or layer that we want to acknowledge as notations.           
As some of the software programs [3,4,5] were successful in sketch recognition or query based on sketch features, I believe that sketches/paintings can be used as a symbol scheme.
