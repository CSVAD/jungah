## Reflection on Bret Victor's essay and talk 

From the 'Stop Drawing Dead Fish', I've learned that when making a tool for artists, I have to think in the aritsts' perspective. I have always thought that artists should learn coding as well in order to fully understand the mechanism and utilize the tool. However, this video has shifted my perspective and I would like to focus more on how I can make tools visually understandable from now on. In addition, how he concluded the talk about relationship between geometry and algebra was very interesting. I realized that many times, I had lack of this connection and thought of them separately. If I consider this inseparable relationship, I think I would better make use of the medium that I am using and build a satisfactory tool for artists, not just for myself. 

As he mentioned in both his essay and talk, there are some dissatisfactions exist when we are using dynamic mediums for static purpose. I realized that the way he thinks of a drawing tool would be a real merge of art and technology, rather than just putting things toegether.
